## why you need this
**type.** is like a blank notebook. 

![notebook in comparison with type](https://github.com/qurle/type/blob/main/.github/notebook.png)


Distractions and interfaces may restrain your thoughts. Unleash your creativity and just type your thoughts / blog posts / notes / docs.

You can also switch between themes and fonts. Every wish to have notebook with colored pages?

Type is local and private and works even in offline mode. Export and upload markdown and text files, copy and paste webiste pages. Right in your browser. 

## mark it down
Every note is markdown file.

Markdown is easy markup language which makes **type.** more than plain text editor. 

For example, there are things like `# Headings`, `**bold texts**` and <code>\`code\`</code>. You can check more rules [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## technologies
Shout out to [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/) â€” core engine of **type.**. There is [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) framework under the hood.


## special thanks
Of course **type.** is inspired by apps like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [Teletype](https://teletype.in/), [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) and [Notion](https://notion.so/). It was created as DIY alternative, but it's also the project I'd like to evolve.
