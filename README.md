Zen editor for those who love simplicity.

## why you need this
**type.** is like a blank notebook. 

![notebook in comparison with type](https://github.com/qurle/type/blob/main/.github/notebook.png)


Distractions and interfaces may restrain your thought. Unleash your creativity and just type your thoughts / blog posts / notes / docs.
Fast and simple. 

You can also switch between themes and fonts. Every wish to have notebook with colored pages?

## mark it down
Every note is markdown file.

You can download it and upload via drag'n'drop (mobiles, we'll catch you later!). Markdown is easy markup language which makes **type.** more than plain text editor. 

For example, there are things like `# Headings`, `**bold texts**` and <code>\`code\`</code>. You can check more rules [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## technologies
Shout out to [MDXEditor](https://github.com/mdx-editor/editor) â€” core engine of **type.** It's not always perfect, but it can do a lot of things. There are also [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) frameworks under the hood.

Notes and styling are saved locally, so it works quite fast. Offline mode is coming soon.

## special thanks
Of course **type.** is inspired by apps like [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [Teletype](https://teletype.in/), [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/) and [Notion](https://notion.so/). It was created as DIY alternative, but it's also the project I'd like to evolve.
